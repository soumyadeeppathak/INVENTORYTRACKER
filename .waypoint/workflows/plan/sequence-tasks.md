# Step 3/4: Sequence & Dependencies

> Order tasks and identify dependencies

## Objective

Create a logical sequence that respects dependencies.

## Inputs Required

- Task list from Step 2

## Outputs Produced

- Sequenced task list with dependencies

---

## Step 3: Sequence & Dependencies

### Your Objective
Order tasks so dependencies are built before dependents.

### Dependency Types
- **Hard**: Task B cannot start until Task A is complete
- **Soft**: Task B is easier if Task A is done first
- **None**: Tasks can be done in parallel

### Sequencing Rules
1. Foundation tasks first
2. Domain before Application
3. Application before Infrastructure (in Clean Architecture)
4. Tests alongside or immediately after implementation

### Output Format
```
Phase 1: Foundation
- Task 001: [title] (no dependencies)
- Task 002: [title] (no dependencies)

Phase 2: Domain
- Task 003: [title] (depends on: 001)
- Task 004: [title] (depends on: 001)

Phase 3: Application
- Task 005: [title] (depends on: 003, 004)
...
```

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to the next step, confirm:

> **Is the sequence logical? Are all dependencies identified?**
